##1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I focus on comprehensive testing and adhere to secure coding practices. For instance, in the unit tests for the Contact Service, I tested every method to confirm correct behavior under normal and exceptional conditions. To enhance security, I incorporate practices such as input validation to prevent SQL injections and data encryption when necessary. I can also use tools like static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities before deployment.

##2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs involves communicating with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and user testing to collect requirements. In my projects, I ensure that the functionalities developed, such as adding, deleting, and updating contacts, align with user expectations for a contact management system. Incorporating user feedback into the development cycles helps refine the program according to real-world use and expectations.

##3. How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design systematically, starting with gathering clear requirements, followed by drafting a design using models and diagrams like UML. In developing the Contact Service, I designed it to ensure modularity and testability. I use design patterns and principles such as SOLID to create a robust architecture. Iterative testing and integration ensure that the design meets the requirements and performs efficiently under different scenarios. I maintain documentation throughout the development process to keep the design aligned with its implementation.
